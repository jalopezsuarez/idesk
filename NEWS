Version 0.7.5
* Major bug fixes:
        - Problem with the background changer system. This it changes the backgr
ound color and you still have a green background although you don't have anyone
Background instructions in the .ideskrc file. The solution let you can use the B
ackground.Delay option with 0 value to disable the background system (without de
lete nothing more from .ideskrc file). But if you don't have anyone Background i
nstructions, the default value will be 0 anyway. The bug is fixed.
        - Problem with startup notification support (option --enable-libsn). The
 idesk-0.7.4 chrashes after starting xmms. This bug was reported by Gentoo users
. If you don't have the support for statup notification the program works well.
The bug is fixed.

* Minor bug fixed:
        - When you click with mouse either for reload Idesk or run a program, an
d you don't move the mouse of position then all icons stay with a glow effect ho
w they had obtained the focus (all in the same time), they back to the normal st
ate if you pass the mouse through the each icon. This bug is solved.
        - Fixed a problem with the Idesk source (configure.in file) for avoid th
e xlibs-dev dependencies.
